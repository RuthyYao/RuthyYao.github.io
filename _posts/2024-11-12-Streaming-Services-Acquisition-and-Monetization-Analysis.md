# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Business Problem <a name="overview-business-problem"></a>
Foodie Fi started the video streaming service that only had food related content a year ago. They sell monthly and annual sbuscription plans, giving their customer unlimited on-demand access to exclusively food related vedios from around the world. The management team wants to review the product performance and would like to rely on data to inform their future investment decisions on new product features, customer acquisition and retention and other business growth strategies.

### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>
I first compiled the necessary data from the data tables that contains the plans and customer subscriptions data.
Then I consolidated the data tables and from there, I learned about the diffenet customer onboarding journeys. 
Next, I applied SQL syntax to perform the data analysis and exploration where I gained the insights on some key business performance metrics such as 
* The number of newly acquried customers
* The customers distribution by products
* The percentage of customers who upgrade their plans
* The average days for customers to upgrade from trial to a paid premium plan. etc.

On top of that, I also created a payment table that allows the business to work out the monthly revenue which would give us fruther insights on the business growth.

### Results <a name="overview-results"></a>
Foodie Fi has 1000 customers. They acquried 80 new customers each month on average. In 2021, there were 123 customers upgrade to the the pro plan (paid premium plans) and 71 customers churned. Foodie Fi's customer churn rate is 30.7%. Data shows that after the trial, 55% of the customers upgrade to the basic monthly plan, 32.5% of the customers subscribed the pro monthly plan, 3.7% of the customers upgraded to the pro annual plan straightaway and 9.2% of the customers churned.
