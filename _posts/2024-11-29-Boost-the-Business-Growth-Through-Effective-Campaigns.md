# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Business Problem <a name="overview-business-problem"></a>
Clique Bait has established the e-commerce channel dive months ago. The management team wants to establish a view on the online store performance and identify the areas for improvement so they achieve faster business growth. 

### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>
I first compiled the necessary data from five datasets that provided the customer data, page visits and campaigns information.

Based on the business requirement, I split the analysis task into three parts:

 - **Part 1 - Digital Analysis**  - to extract insights on the customer visits, page views and purchases.
 - **Part 2 - Product Funnel** - create a product funnel to analyse the add-to-cart rate and purchase rate.
 - **Part 3 - Campaign Analysis** - to evaluate the success of each campaign.
   
For each part of the analysis, I used SQL for data extraction and manipulation, gaining the insights on online store conversions, top performing products and the most effective campaigns.  

### Results <a name="overview-results"></a>
Clique Bait has acquired 500 customers over the last four to five months. On average each customer visits the online store for 7.1 times over five-months period. The purchase rate is ~50%. The average add-to-cart rate is 61% and the conversion from add-to-cart to purchase is ~76%. About 15.5% of time customers visit the checkout page but didn't make a purchase.

The most purchased product is lobster which also has the highest view-to-purchase conversion rate. The top 3 visited pages are Oyster, Crab followed by Russian Caviar. Ironically, Russian Caviar is also the most likely to be abandoned product (add to cart but not purchased) with an abandoned rate of 26%. 

Campaigns had substantially boosted the page views. From January to March, Clique Bait run three campaigns, resulting in page view reaching above 800 marks. In contrast, during April and May when there arenâ€™t any campaigns, the page visits dropped to 200. Compare the customers who receive the campaign ad impression with those who didn't receive the impression, the purchase rate was substantially higher for the former - 89% vs the latter 28%, which proved that campaigns effectively drive the sales. 

Of the three campaigns, "half-price" promotion achieves the highest impression-to-purchase conversion rate - 85.3% followed by "Buy-one-get-one-free" achieved 84.6%. 


### Insights & Recommendations <a name="overview-insights-recommendations"></a>

To boost the sales growth, the management team should focus on managing the conversion rate, particularly the conversion from page view to add-to-cart and from add-to-cart to finally making the purchase. In this aspect, the management should keep an eye on the customers who visit the checkout page but didn't make purchases. It is recommended that we collect further information to understand what caused the customers drop the basket. 

The management team could consider optimize the campigns to driver further sales uplift. Based on the sales and click-view performance of the previous three campaigns, "Half-Price" and "Buy-one-get-one-free" are the most effective. Management team could consider extend the reach of those campaigns in future if the budget permits. Suggest do further customer behaviours analysis to identify what types of customers are more likely to click the ad so we can target the customers to run the promotion to driver better outcome.

The analysis shows that Oyster and Crab are the most purchased products. The management team could leverage the data insights to plan the purchase and stocking. Luxury category reveals very distinctive shopping behaviours - high views but low conversion. The management team could consider implement some limited-time promotions such as flash sales to generate excitement, drive sales and this could also help clear out excessive stocks.

### Growth/Next Steps <a name="overview-growth"></a>

* To drive the conversion rate up, we could test different promotional strategies and track the change of the product funnel conversion and fallout rate. 

* We could also collect external data to establish a benchmark for the key metrics to help us better gauge our performance. 

* Further analysis on customers visits and shopping basket to segment the customers and develop more customerized campaigns and promotions.


# Data Overview  <a name="data-overview"></a>

![alt text](/img/clique-bait/case-study-6-erd.PNG "Entity Relationship Diagram")
<br>

The original dataset have five data tables. The primary data table is "events" which is the raw data of the customer visits. It stores the visits id, the visti time, the page visited and the activities on the page. 

<br>

The "users" table stores the customers information including their user id and the cookies they have and the time each cookie generated. 
<br>

"Event_identifier"  and "Page Hierarchy" are mapping tables. The former provides the activities names for each event_id and the page name and the latter maps out the page_name and product hierarchy for each page id. Note that each product has a page Hence it has a unique page id and product id. 
<br>

Finally, the "campaign identifier" table provide the three campaigns's start date and end date and the products that the camppaign was on.


# Part 1 - Data Analysis  <a name="data-analysis"></a>

## Digital Analysis <a name="digital-analysis"></a>

### 1. Calculate total number of customers.
```SQL
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS customer_count
FROM users;
```

| customer_count |
|----------------|
| 500            |


### 2. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
```SQL
SELECT 
	DATE_FORMAT(event_time,'%Y-%m') As period,
    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS visits
FROM events
GROUP BY period;
```

| period  | visits |
|---------|--------|
| 2020-01 | 876    |
| 2020-02 | 1488   |
| 2020-03 | 916    |
| 2020-04 | 248    |
| 2020-05 | 36     |

### 3. What is the number of events for each event type?

```SQL
SELECT
	e.event_type,
    ei.event_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS event_count
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN event_Identifier AS ei
	ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
GROUP BY e.event_type, ei.event_name;
```
| event_type | event_name    | event_count |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1          | Page View     | 3564        |
| 2          | Add to Cart   | 2510        |
| 3          | Purchase      | 1777        |
| 4          | Ad Impression | 876         |
| 5          | Ad Click      | 702         |

### 4. Breakdown the number of events by months
```SQL
WITH event_count AS(
SELECT
	DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(e.event_time, '%Y-%m') AS period,
    e.event_type,
    ei.event_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)  AS event_count
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN event_Identifier AS ei
	ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
GROUP BY period, e.event_type, ei.event_name
ORDER BY period, e.event_type, ei.event_name
)
SELECT
	period,
    MAX(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Page View' THEN event_count ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
	MAX(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN event_count ELSE 0 END) AS add_to_cart,   
    MAX(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Purchase' THEN event_count ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,   
    MAX(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN event_count ELSE 0 END) AS impression,   
    MAX(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN event_count ELSE 0 END) AS clicks
FROM event_count
GROUP BY period;
```

| period  | page_view | add_to_cart | purchase | impression | clicks |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 2020-01 | 876       | 614         | 430      | 216        | 173    |
| 2020-02 | 1488      | 1054        | 744      | 371        | 291    |
| 2020-03 | 916       | 635         | 448      | 214        | 178    |
| 2020-04 | 248       | 177         | 134      | 63         | 48     |
| 2020-05 | 36        | 30          | 21       | 12         | 12     |

Jan to March has more website activities than April and May. This was because Clique Bait run three campaigns in Q1. 


### 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
```SQL
SELECT
	ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM events),1) AS purchase_percentage
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN event_Identifier AS ei
	ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
WHERE event_name = 'Purchase';
```

| purchase_percentage |
|---------------------|
| 49.9                |

About half of the visits lead to a purchase. 

### 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
```SQL
WITH cte AS(
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT e.visit_id) AS checkout_page_visits
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN event_Identifier AS ei
	ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy AS p
	ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE ei.event_name = 'Page View'
	AND p.page_name = 'Checkout'
)
SELECT
	ROUND((1- COUNT(DISTINCT e.visit_id) /  (SELECT checkout_page_visits FROM cte)) * 100,2)  AS checkout_page_no_purchase 
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN event_Identifier AS ei
	ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
WHERE ei.event_name = 'Purchase';
```

| checkout_page_no_purchase |
|---------------------------|
| 15.50                     |

15.5% of the visits abandoned the checkout.

### 7. What are the top 3 product pages by number of views?
```SQL
SELECT
    p.page_name,
    COUNT(e.visit_id) AS num_views
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy AS p
	ON	e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE e.event_type = 1
	AND p.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.page_name
ORDER BY num_views DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

| page_name      | num_views |
|----------------|-----------|
| Oyster         | 1568      |
| Crab           | 1564      |
| Russian Caviar | 1563      |


### 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
```SQL
SELECT
	p.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_views,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_add_cart
FROM events AS e
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy AS p
	ON	e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.product_category;
```

| product_category | num_views | num_add_cart |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Luxury           | 3032      | 1870         |
| Shellfish        | 6204      | 3792         |
| Fish             | 4633      | 2789         |


### 9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?
```SQL
-- Solution structure: 
	-- Purchased products are those which are add to the cart in the product page AND are purchased in the confirmation page.
    	-- Hence break down the question into two layers:
		-- 1. products are add to cart.
		-- 2. products are purchased (use subquery)

SELECT
    p.page_name,
    p.product_category,
    COUNT(e.visit_id) AS purchases
FROM events AS e 
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy AS p
	ON p.page_id = e.page_id
WHERE e.event_type = 2  -- 1st layer - products are add to cart.
AND e.visit_id IN 
	(SELECT
		visit_id
	FROM events
    WHERE event_type = 3) -- 2nd layer - products are purchased.
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.page_name, p.product_category
ORDER BY purchases DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

| page_name | product_category | purchases |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Lobster   | Shellfish        | 754       |
| Oyster    | Shellfish        | 726       |
| Crab      | Shellfish        | 719       |


### 10. How many times did each customer visit the online store averagely? And what is the customer number distribution by visits?
```SQL
WITH visit_cte AS(
SELECT 
	users.user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id) AS visits
FROM users
LEFT JOIN events
	ON users.cookie_id = events.cookie_id
GROUP BY users.user_id
)
SELECT
	AVG(visits) AS avg_visits_per_customer
FROM visit_cte;
```

| avg_visits_per_customer |
|-------------------------|
| 7.1280                  |

On average, customers visited the store 7.1 times over the five-months period.

```SQL
WITH visit_cte AS(
SELECT 
	users.user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id) AS visits
FROM users
LEFT JOIN events
	ON users.cookie_id = events.cookie_id
GROUP BY users.user_id
)
SELECT
	visits AS visit_freqency,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS customer_count
FROM visit_cte
GROUP BY visits;
```

| visit_freqency | customer_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| 2              | 18             |
| 4              | 77             |
| 6              | 138            |
| 8              | 166            |
| 10             | 74             |
| 12             | 27             |

### 11. How many purchases did each customer make averagely?
```SQL
WITH purchase_cte AS(
SELECT 
	users.user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id) AS visits
FROM users
LEFT JOIN events
	ON users.cookie_id = events.cookie_id
WHERE event_type = 3
GROUP BY users.user_id
)
SELECT
	AVG(visits) AS avg_purchases_per_customer
FROM purchase_cte;
```

| avg_purchases_per_customer |
|----------------------------|
| 3.6715                     |

On average, customers did 3.7 times shopping with Clique Bait over the five-months period.

## Product Funnel <a name="product-funnel"></a>
I'll create a new output table that contains the following details.

* How many times was each product viewed?
* How many times was each product added to cart?
* How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
* How many times was each product purchased?

```SQL
-- Solution Structure
    -- Create a CTE prod_view: calculate the number of views and number of cart_adds for each product using CASE() and SUM()
    -- Create a CTE prod_abandon: calculate the number of abandoned products (Note: use the solution for Q9 in the Digital Analysis section. Only need to replace IN by NOT IN in the subquery).
    -- Create a CTE prod_purchased: calculate the number of purchased products (solution for Q9 in the Digital Analysis section)
    -- JOIN the above three CTEs using product_id, product_name and product_category of each product
    -- Store the result in a temporary table product_summary for further analysis

CREATE TABLE product_summary
